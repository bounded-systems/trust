# Claims Ledger

Every security/trust claim Bounded Systems makes about itself, graded against
running code. Evidence is given as `repo/path · symbol` so you can `grep` and
check it. Open work is linked to its bead id.

**Grades:** ✅ Enforced · 🟡 Partial · 🔴 Gap · 📐 Design-only · ⚙️ By design
(see [README](./README.md#how-claims-are-graded)).

> This ledger is itself a set of claims. It is graded by the same instrument it
> describes (`prx/docs/claims-audit-instrument-v0.md`). If a row drifts from the
> code, that is a defect — please [report it](./SECURITY.md).

## 1. Capability model (object-capability / ocap)

| # | Claim | Grade | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Authority can only be **narrowed** as it is handed onward, never widened. | ✅ Enforced (model) | `guest-room` attenuation; `dotgithub/knowledge/ocap-doors.md` | Core ocap invariant (Miller/E lineage). |
| 1.2 | A door is a single unit of authority — you hold a socket to a brokered service, never the keys behind it. | ✅ Enforced (model) | `dotgithub/knowledge/ocap-doors.md` | Sockets/fd-passing mechanism itself is 🟡 (row 1.3). |
| 1.3 | A door is a socket you hold — the held reference is the unforgeable capability. | ✅ Enforced | claude-box per-door mounts (`planDoorMounts`, `door-mounts.test.ts`, #159/#161) | The mechanism was framed as "lives in the unbuilt `bellhop` broker"; in fact it's **live in claude-box**. A box gets bind-mounts for **only** its granted door sockets — the mounted set IS the capability set, and a non-granted door is **physically absent**, not merely denied (ADR-CAPABILITY-TRANSPORT). Proven: `door-mounts.test.ts` (a scout-only box has no mount path to keeper/net/launcher), VM-verified reference-passing (#159/#161), and e2e in the Linux VM — a container **with** the door mounted reaches it (`REACHED:{pong:true}`), **without** the mount it gets `Failed to connect`. (Realized by per-door bind-mounts rather than SCM_RIGHTS fd-passing; the held reference is the authority either way.) |
| 1.4 | Credentials are held as references, not values — callers get an `authorize()` capability, never the token. | ✅ Enforced (in-process) | `auth/keymaker.ts · createServiceKeymaker` | **Scope is honest:** this is an in-process *discipline* guarantee, not isolation — in-process code can still read the closure. Isolation is a layered profile (Lima microVM under `--vm`; SES/Deno/WASI are the upgrade paths). |
| 1.5 | A minted credential expires — use after TTL fails closed. | ✅ Enforced | `auth/keymaker.ts · authorize` → `CredentialExpiredError` | Runtime TTL check. |

## 2. Policy enforcement

| # | Claim | Grade | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | The policy guard **fails closed**: an unknown tool/state/role is denied, never allowed by fallthrough. | ✅ Enforced | `policy/src/index.ts:480 · checkPolicy` (`allowList ? allowList.includes(sub) : false`) | Sibling predicate returns explicit `unknown-tool` reason. |
| 2.2 | Policy is data: allowlists keyed by tool × state × role; decisions are pure lookups, no ambient authority. | ✅ Enforced | `policy/src/index.ts · POLICY_TABLE` | Table-driven, deterministic. |
| 2.3 | An agent cannot perform an action its role doesn't own (keeper owns git writes, forge owns gh writes, orchestrator owns nothing). | ✅ Enforced | `prx/.../agents/policy_guard.ts · decideAgentToolCall`; `prx/.../test/agents/policy_guard.test.ts` | Wired as a PreToolUse hook (`prx/.claude/hooks/policy-guard.ts`) — exits non-zero to deny on every command. |
| 2.4 | Ownership claims in the feature specs match runtime enforcement. | ✅ Enforced | `prx/.../test/agents/capability_feature.test.ts` ("FAITHFUL: a role owns a write iff the predicate allows it") | Faithfulness test compares spec to `isFeasibleForRole`. |
| 2.5 | Policy guard fails closed on **unparseable** policed commands (not just unknown ones). | ✅ Enforced | `prx/.../agents/policy_guard.ts · decideAgentToolCall` / `parsePolicedCommand` | A policed-tool head with no parseable verb fails closed (policy roles + orchestrator); value-taking options (`git -C`, `gh -R`) no longer let a value masquerade as the verb. prx#760 (bead `prx-w1v`, closed). |

## 3. Capability seams (single access points)

| # | Claim | Grade | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Each domain has exactly **one** sanctioned access point (subprocess, env, host, fs, secrets, git, gh…), enforced by tests — no upward deps, no ambient authority. | ✅ Enforced | 23 packages via the shared [`@bounded-systems/seam-check`](https://github.com/bounded-systems/seam-check) harness (`cas`, `proc`, `env`, `host`, `fs`, `auth`, `git`, `policy`, …) | Zero-tolerance: `assertSeam` reports `{imports:[], ambient:[]}` or throws — no upward deps, no `child_process`/`process.env` outside the allowlist. |
| 3.2 | Seam coverage is **complete** — nothing escapes the net. | ✅ Enforced | **24** packages adopt [`@bounded-systems/seam-check`](https://github.com/bounded-systems/seam-check); beads `prx-5yp`, `prx-w2mf` | The hand-rolled, copy-pasted extractability tests were replaced by one shared importable harness — the allowlist a package passes *is* its declared claim. No real prod escapes surfaced; several seams (`host`, `env`, `auth`, `repo-root`, `installer`) **gained** ambient checks they previously lacked. The org-level coverage meta-test (`assertAllPackagesChecked`) is **wired org-wide** by the scheduled `seam-coverage` workflow in `bounded-systems/.github`: it discovers every capability repo (a `package.json` with a `bounded` block) and fails CI on any uncovered one — so a brand-new uncovered package can't slip in. Wiring it caught that `slack`'s migration had never merged (fixed) plus 4 uncovered catalog repos; `schema-gen` + `ocap-provenance` were then migrated (the latter also gained its first test-running CI). The only exempt repos are now **2 permanent** (the harness itself; the `guest-room` runtime — a composition, not a leaf) and `door-kit`, whose raw-`node` posture is a tracked maintainer decision (`prx-w2mf`). |
| 3.3 | No agent mutates git ambiently (bypassing the prx seam). | ✅ Enforced | `prx/.../audit/invariants.ts · assertNoAmbientGit` (I-AUD4) | Baseline: zero ambient-git violations. |

## 4. Provenance & attestation

| # | Claim | Grade | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Bytes are addressed by their SHA-256 digest; authority lives in the digest, not in who produced the bytes. | ✅ Enforced | `cas/README.md · BlobStore`; verifier re-hashes on read | Zero-dependency substrate (`node:crypto` only). |
| 4.2 | A derivation's identity is content-addressed — any manifest change changes its id. | ✅ Enforced | `anchored-chain` · canonical manifest digest | Deterministic, key-order independent. |
| 4.3 | Derivations are signed (Ed25519) and projected to in-toto statements wrapped in DSSE envelopes. | ✅ Enforced | `anchored-chain/README.md`; pure core, `node:crypto` + `cas` only | Format is emitted correctly. |
| 4.4 | Attestations are verifiable by **off-the-shelf** in-toto/DSSE tooling. | ✅ Enforced | `anchored-chain/src/__tests__/dsse-interop.test.ts` (bead `prx-5lcd`) | A real envelope is verified with an **independent** ed25519 implementation (`@noble/ed25519`, not `node:crypto`) and a DSSE PAE reimplemented from the spec (not our code): it accepts the genuine envelope, rejects a tampered payload, and validates the in-toto Statement v1 shape. (A full external-binary check via `cosign`/`in-toto-verify` is a heavier future add; the format interop is now proven in CI.) |
| 4.5 | Attestations conform to the in-toto Statement v1 + SLSA Provenance v1 **format** (no build *level* claimed). | ✅ Enforced (format) | `ocap-provenance/slsa.ts` + `slsa-conformance.test.ts` ([ocap-provenance#10](https://github.com/bounded-systems/ocap-provenance/pull/10)) | `slsa.ts` projects our open `CapabilityProvenance v0.1` spec onto the **standard** in-toto Statement v1 + `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1` predicate. Now **proven, not asserted**: `slsa-conformance.test.ts` validates a real projection against the published spec requirements — transcribed from in-toto `statement.md` + `slsa.dev`, checked with generic structural predicates (not our TS types) — the schema-layer analogue of the 4.4 DSSE proof. So **"the exact formats match"** — the threshold the kinship stance set. What stays kinship, by design: **no SLSA build *level*** (the `buildType` URIs are custom and a level needs build-integrity guarantees, not just format). Conformance on the *format*; kinship on the *level*. |
| 4.6 | Every surface read (`file`, `grep`, `files`) is content-addressed and anchored, so what an agent saw is verifiable after the fact. | ✅ Enforced | `scout/README.md`; depends on `anchored-chain`/`cas` | Provenance detects surface drift. |
| 4.7 | The provenance stamp uses `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, never wall-clock — re-runs are byte-identical. | ✅ Enforced | `synoptic-github/README.md:56` | Determinism vector closed. |

## 5. Supply-chain (published packages)

| # | Claim | Grade | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | All published `@bounded-systems` packages enable npm **build provenance**. | ✅ Enforced | 24/24 first-party `package.json` with `"provenance": true`; remaining matches are vendored `node_modules` | `grep -rlE '"provenance":[[:space:]]*true' --include=package.json . \| grep -v node_modules` |
| 5.2 | Packages publish to JSR via **tokenless OIDC** (no long-lived credentials). | ✅ Enforced | 34 × `publish-jsr.yml` with `permissions: id-token: write` | GitHub OIDC exchanged for publish rights. |

## 6. Pipeline verification (the honest gaps)

| # | Claim | Grade | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | git-writes are signed **and verified against their owner**. | ✅ Enforced | `prx` provenance signing; default-on ([prx#789](https://github.com/bounded-systems/prx/pull/789)) | Ownership is verified on the live merge gate (row 6.2), and verification is now **default-on / fail-closed** ([prx#789](https://github.com/bounded-systems/prx/pull/789)): the merge-guard and publisher tier previously *skipped verification entirely* when `PRX_REQUIRE_SIGNED_DERIVATIONS` was unset; now unset ⇒ enforced, and the gate fails closed on a missing/invalid/unverifiable derivation. The opt-out (`PRX_REQUIRE_SIGNED_DERIVATIONS=0`) is the documented escape hatch where a verifier can't yet be configured. |
| 6.2 | A privileged effect not produced by its owning actor fails verification. | ✅ Enforced | `prx/.../provenance/merge-guard.ts · projectProvenanceAxis` → `verifyEffectOwnership` | Wired into the live merge gate (`canEnterReadyToMerge`): under enforcement, a signature-valid effect whose producer doesn't own it fails closed (`unsigned`). prx#759 (bead `prx-6s8`, closed). Non-effect / non-role producers pass through. |
| 6.3 | Caveat / attenuation enforcement is by interposition (proxy), so a narrowed door is a genuinely weaker capability. | ✅ Enforced | launcherd interposer ([claude-box#163](https://github.com/bounded-systems/claude-box/pull/163), [#167](https://github.com/bounded-systems/claude-box/pull/167)); bead `prx-yweb` | Re-framed: "string compare" mischaracterized the gap — `checkCaveats` already dispatches broker verifiers fail-closed and `attenuatesDoors` is a proven set-superset (65k cases). The real gap was that narrowing was **metadata**: a delegated child held the *same upstream reference*. Closed: the rest of `prx-86g9` (reference-passing spawn #158/#159, cgroup caller-correlation #161, lineage-retirement #162) landed, and `launcherd.handleLaunch` now **fronts each caveated unix door with an interposer** that holds the upstream socket and runs `checkCaveats` per request — the box mounts only the proxy (default-on; uncaveated/tcp doors unchanged). Every link of the live path is verified: `frontDoorsWithInterposers` **e2e through launcherd's real code** across a real podman bind-mount in the Linux VM (a client container gets `read` allowed, `write` off-caveat `DENIED`, and the upstream log shows the denied call **never arrived**); `planDoorMounts` asserted to mount the **proxy**, never the upstream (#167); and the per-door mount machinery it rides on VM-verified (#159/#161). A narrowed door is now a structurally weaker capability — the box cannot invoke the off-caveat method, full stop. |

## 7. Operator hygiene

| # | Claim | Grade | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Keeper/executor git commits are signed by default. | ✅ Enforced | git seam + `commit-signing-key.ts` + keeper `commit-tree` guard + `submit/publish.ts` wiring; verb `prx provenance commit-pubkey` | The **direct keeper path signs by default** with prx's OWN internal ed25519 key — generate-on-first-use under `<state>/prx/signing`, never the host `~/.ssh` or a cloud KMS, never the 1Password agent. The keeper **fails closed** if a configured-to-sign commit comes out unsigned. Both deployment steps are now done: **(1)** the key is registered on the GitHub account as a Signing Key (id `1026660`), and **(2)** the wiring is in the **installed** binary — `prx` **v0.16.1** runs `provenance commit-pubkey` and ships the keeper signing (no longer a release-behind). Verified end-to-end: this row's own commit is signed with the key and GitHub reports it **Verified**. The keyless remote path (`keeperd/host.ts`) is signed in-VM, unchanged. bead `prx-e7cl`; the Ed25519 provenance chain stays the primary integrity layer. |

## 8. Semantic git

| # | Claim | Grade | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1a | Format enforcement: a canonical clean/smudge round-trip, so reformatting never reaches history. | ✅ Enforced | `git-ast` runs Git's real `filter-process` pkt-line protocol; `clean` parses source and stores a **deterministic, idempotent** canonical form, `smudge` returns it, **fail-closed** on parse errors. Proven against real `git` by the cucumber claims suite (`git-ast/tests/features/claims.feature`) + CI (fmt/build/test/clippy). Coverage: **Rust** (Tree-sitter, a documented subset — `git-ast/src/printer.rs`) and **JSON** (`serde_json`, `git-ast/src/json.rs`), both on `main` (PRs #26, #27). | Two differently-formatted-but-equal inputs store byte-identical blobs. The round-trip *mechanism* is enforced; language/construct coverage widens additively. |
| 8.1b | AST-level **semantic merge** (structural 3-way merge; AST diff/merge drivers). | 📐 Design-only | `git-ast` diff/merge drivers are placeholders; depends on stable AST **node identity** (see the node-identity section in `git-ast/README.md`). | The hard part — tracking a node through moves/renames. Canonical formatting (8.1a) removes formatting churn from history but does **not** yet perform structural merge. |

## Open calibration work

The meta-claim — *"the public claims match live enforcement"* — is itself tracked:

- `prx-suz` — Claims calibration: close the gap between repo claims and live enforcement (+ periodic claims audit).
- `prx-99s` — Re-tier STATUS value props + soften README tagline to match live enforcement.
- ~~`prx-6s8` — Wire `verifyEffectOwnership` into the merge-guard path~~ ✅ done ([prx#759](https://github.com/bounded-systems/prx/pull/759)). ~~Residual: make signed verification **default-on** (row 6.1)~~ ✅ done ([prx#789](https://github.com/bounded-systems/prx/pull/789)) — default-on / fail-closed, opt out with `PRX_REQUIRE_SIGNED_DERIVATIONS=0`.
- `prx-5yp` — Close the ~13 silent seam violations (`node:fs`/`node:os` outside fs/host) or baseline them explicitly.
- `prx-w1v` — policy_guard: fail closed on unparseable policed commands + adversarial parser tests.
- `prx-e7cl` — Keeper/worktree commits unsigned by default — decide on signing by default.

When one of these closes, its row above moves grade — and that movement is the
point of keeping the ledger public.
